# Wordle
## Creating a program that simulates Worlde, and eventually add in optimization through probability and information theory
### Road Map
1. Create base similator in terminal    (*In progress*)
2. Implement next guess options and probability      (*To do*)
3. Add in entropy calculators and integrate with probability calculations       (*To do*)
4. TBA      (*To do*)
