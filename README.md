# Wordle
## Creating a program that simulates Worlde, and eventually add in optimization through probability and information theory
### Road Map
1. - [X] Create base similator in terminal 
   - [ ] Finalise all rules and scores
2. - [ ] Implement next guess options and probability      (*In Progress*)
   - [ ] Add weightings to words
   - [ ] Display Most probable next guess
3. - [ ] Add in entropy calculators and integrate with probability calculations       (*To do*)
4. TBA      (*To do*)
